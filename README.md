# My Compilation of JavaScript Small Projects
By Ford Laturnas


Just to fully grasp what I learn,I make a small projects.
Some are completed, some are not.
But that's okay, as long as it serves a purpose for me.
To know the functionality and to make it into reality.

:speak_no_evil: (I'm currently working on some BIG projects too....)
